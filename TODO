Yak stack:
  ☐ Fast blocking accidentally works for fast unblocking when you do it via the menu @created(Thu 2021-07-22 13:02)
    This is ok, I guess?
  ☐ If you view a blocked person's profile page, you'll see "You might like" suggestions @created(Thu 2021-07-22 12:58)
    Add a Blocked class and use it to hide everything but search in the sidebar
  ☐ The page sometimes isn't processed after fast unblocking someone on their profile page, or with the Unblock button + confirm popup @created(Thu 2021-07-22 13:00)

New features:
  ☐ Hide metrics @created(Fri 2021-07-23 12:56)
    Prune all the numbers, everywhere, for all time
  ☐ Remove quote tweet privileges @created(Thu 2021-07-22 18:20)
    Some people who post otherwise-interesting stuff also spend some of their time "dunking" on known idiots vai quote tweets

    Add a menu item to tweets and the profile menu which lets you mute/unmute someone's quote tweets if you don't want to be invited to their engagement party
  ☐ Hide cards which use your muted words in their text content @created(Thu 2021-07-22 17:56)
    Twitter doesn't do this

    Simple, stupid way would be to synchronise muted words with extension storage when you visit `/settings/muted_keywords`, which already happens any time you add a new muted word

    The other way would be to call the API ourselves to get the words at the start of each new session, BUT to do that we'd have to intercept the necessary credentials, which would mean adding webRequest permissions, which I'm keen to avoid
  ☐ Hide do-nothing options in the Report Tweet flow @created(Tue 2021-07-20 18:48)
    "I'm not interested in this tweet"
    "It's disrespectful or offensive" (Under "It's abusive or harmful")
  ☐ RegExp or simple pattern-based mute @created(Thu 2021-07-22 18:49)
    For when the next snowclone outstays its welcome

Refactoring/tech debt:
  ☐ Use the current URL when possible, rather than the page title @created(Tue 2021-07-20 15:44)
    The title is used everywhere as the first tweak was implementing the separate tweets timeline,
    which doesn't change the URL.

    Using the URL will also make more features Just Work for non-English languages
  ☐ Create a Tweet object which encapsulates finding things out about a tweet Element in the timeline @created(Tue 2021-07-20 15:41)
    <div style="position: absolute; width: 100%; transform: translateY(1234px);">    Timeline container
      <div><div><article><div><div>                                                  Wrrrraaapppiiinng

    Should I hide this tweet?
      Is the tweet a Retweet?
        -> Does the text content of the second above-tweet content element contain 'Retweeted'?
          -> config.retweets != 'ignore'
      Does the tweet quote a muted/blocked account?
        -> Is the text content of the media element 'This Tweet is unavailable.'?
      Is the tweet a reply to a (reply to a (reply to a...)) tweet which was hidden?
