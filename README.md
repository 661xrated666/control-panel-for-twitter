## Features

### Reduce algorithmic content

- Keeps you on the "Latest Tweets" (chronological) timeline, automatically switching you back if time Twitter tries to move you to the "Home" (algorithmic) timeline
- Hide "Who to follow" / "Follow some Topics" etc. sections in the timeline
- Hide "What's happening" / "Topics to follow" etc. in the sidebar
- Hide "More Tweets" when linked to a tweet

### Control which tweets shared by people you follow appear on your timeline

- Move Retweets to a separate timeline (default setting), or hide them entirely
- Move Quote Tweets and replies to them to a separate timeline, or hide them entirely (off by default)

### UI improvements

- Use the site's normal text font style in the primary navigation menu to make it less distracting
- Fast blocking - skips the confir dialog when you try to block someone
- When viewing a tweet's Quote Tweets, pin the quoted tweet instead of duplicating it in every tweet
- Hide any navigation items you don't use, such as the Explore, Bookmarks and Links navigation items, the account switcher, and the Messages drawer
