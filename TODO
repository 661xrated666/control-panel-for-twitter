Support for other display languages (#17):
  ☐ Replace use of `aria-label` attributes and `textContent` with attributes or context which doesn't change across languages @created(Tue 2021-07-20 15:48)
  ☐ Create locale objects with translations for each supported language where the above isn't possible @created(Tue 2021-07-20 15:49)
     We should be able to automate some of this, eg. driving a browser with Puppeteer, we should be
     able to cycle through the languages on https://twitter.com/settings/languages and use selectors
     to pull out the `aria-label` for that language.

New features:
  ☐ Hide useless options in the Report Tweet flow @created(Tue 2021-07-20 18:48)
    "I'm not interested in this tweet"
    "It's disrespectful or offensive" (Under "It's abusive or harmful)

Refactoring/tech debt:
  ☐ Use the current URL when possible, rather than the page title @created(Tue 2021-07-20 15:44)
    The title is used everywhere as the first tweak was implementing the separate tweets timeline,
    which doesn't change the URL.

    Using the URL will also make more features Just Work for non-English languages
  ☐ Create a Tweet object which encapsulates finding things out about a tweet Element in the timeline @created(Tue 2021-07-20 15:41)
    <div style="position: absolute; width: 100%; transform: translateY(1234px);">    Timeline container
      <div><div><article><div><div>                                                  Wrrrraaapppiiinng

                <div class="css-a1b2c3">                                                   Tweet text content (if it has any)

                                                                                           quoted tweet if tweet is a QT

    Should I hide this tweet?
      Is the tweet a Retweet?
        -> Does the text content of the second above-tweet content element contain 'Retweeted'?
          -> config.retweets != 'ignore'
      Does the tweet quote a muted/blocked account?
        -> Is the text content of the media element 'This Tweet is unavailable.'?
      Is the tweet a reply to a (reply to a (reply to a...)) tweet which was hidden?
