## Features


### Home timeline

- Defaults to the "Following" (chronological) timeline, automatically switching you back if Twitter tries to move you to the "For you" (algorithmic) timeline
- Hide the "For you" timeline tab (default setting)
- Move Retweets to a separate tab (default setting), or hide them entirely
- Move Quote Tweets and replies to them to a separate tab in the Home timeline, or hide them entirely
- Hide tweets quoting accounts you've blocked or muted
- Mute quoting of specific tweets - adds a "Mute this conversation" menu item to Quote Tweets in the Home and List timelines
- Hide "Who to follow", "Follow some Topics" etc. in the Home timeline and elsewhere
- Full-width timeline: hide the sidebar and let timeline content go full-width on Home, Lists and Communities

### UI improvements

- Hide Views under tweets
- Hide the "Verified" tab on the Notifications page
- Replace Twitter Blue checkmarks with the Blue logo so they're not as easily mistaken for verified accounts, or hide them altogether
- Add "Add muted word" to the "More" menu (iPad & Mac) or slide-out menu (iPhone)
- Fast blocking - skips the confirm dialog when you try to block an account
- Toggle Retweets in Lists - adds a "Turn off Retweets" menu item to Lists
- Use the site's normal text font style in the primary navigation menu on Mac to make it less distracting
- Use normal font weight in dropdown menus - if everything's bold, nothing's bold
- Hide "Open app" nags on iPhone

### UI tweaks

- Disable use of the Chirp font if you don't like it
- Uninvert the Follow and Following buttons to make them less jarring
  - Choice of monochrome or themed (classic) styling for uninverted buttons
- When viewing a tweet's Quote Tweets, hide the quoted tweet to make more room for quotes

### Remove algorithmic content

- Hide "What's happening", "Topics to follow" etc. in the sidebar
- Hide Explore page contents and use it only for searching
- Hide "Discover more" algorithmic tweets when viewing a tweet

### Reduce "engagement"

- Hide metrics
- Reduced interaction mode: hide the action bar under tweets â€“ replies are now the only means of interacting
- Disable the home timeline: find yourself [wasting too much time on Twitter](https://world.hey.com/brecht/free-range-tweet-farming-9399f6e5)? Try preventing use of the home timeline, going to Notifications or Messages by default instead

### Hide UI items you don't use

- Share button under tweets
- Analytics links under your own tweets
- Hide navigation items you don't use on iPad & Mac, and other distracting screen elements such as the account switcher and Messages drawer
- Hide the bottom nav items for Communities and Messages on iPhone if you don't use them
- Hide items you don't use in the "More" menu (iPad & Mac) or slide-out menu (iPhone)
