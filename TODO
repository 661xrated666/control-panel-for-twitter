Yak stack:
  ☐ Handle being on the Home timeline, switching to the separated tweets timeline then enabling "Always use latest tweets" @created(Sat 2021-07-31 04:32)
    Should use the sparkle menu to move you over to latest tweets then put you on the separated tweets timeline
  ☐ The page sometimes isn't processed after fast unblocking someone on their profile page, or with the Unblock button + confirm popup @created(Thu 2021-07-22 13:00)
  ☐ Promoted tweets can appear in search results @created(Sat 2021-07-31 01:06)

New features:
  ☐ Hide cards which use your muted words in their text content @created(Thu 2021-07-22 17:56)
    Twitter doesn't do this

    Simple, stupid way would be to synchronise muted words with extension storage when you visit `/settings/muted_keywords`, which already happens any time you add a new muted word

    The other way would be to call the API ourselves to get the words at the start of each new session, BUT to do that we'd have to intercept the necessary credentials, which would mean adding webRequest permissions, which I'm keen to avoid
  ☐ Hide do-nothing options in the Report Tweet flow @created(Tue 2021-07-20 18:48)
    "I'm not interested in this tweet"
    "It's disrespectful or offensive" (Under "It's abusive or harmful")
  ☐ RegExp or simple pattern-based mute @created(Thu 2021-07-22 18:49)
    For when the next snowclone outstays its welcome
  ☐ Allow specific sidebar sections to be shown @created(Fri 2021-07-23 23:40)

    Should I hide this tweet?
      Is the tweet a Retweet?
        -> Does the text content of the second above-tweet content element contain 'Retweeted'?
          -> config.retweets != 'ignore'
      Does the tweet quote a muted/blocked account?
        -> Is the text content of the media element 'This Tweet is unavailable.'?
      Is the tweet a reply to a (reply to a (reply to a...)) tweet which was hidden?
