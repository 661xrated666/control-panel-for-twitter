## Features

### Reduce algorithmic content

- Keeps you on the "Latest Tweets" (chronological) timeline, automatically switching you back if Twitter tries to move you to the "Home" (algorithmic) timeline
- Hide "Who to follow", "Follow some Topics" etc. in the timeline
- Hide "What's happening", "Topics to follow" etc. in the sidebar on desktop
- Hide "More Tweets" when linked to a tweet
- Hide Explore page contents on mobile and use it only for searching

### Control which tweets shared by people you follow appear on your timeline

- Move Retweets to a separate timeline (default setting), or hide them entirely
- Move Quote Tweets and replies to them to a separate timeline, or hide them entirely (off by default)

### UI improvements

- Fast blocking - skips the confirm dialog when you try to block an account
- Add a new item to the "More" menu (desktop) or slide-out menu (mobile) which takes you straight to the "Add muted word" page
- When viewing a tweet's Quote Tweets, pin the quoted tweet (desktop) or hide duplication of it in every tweet (mobile)
- Hide "Open app", "Switch to the app" etc. nags on mobile
- Use the site's normal text font style in the primary navigation menu on desktop to make it less distracting
- Hide navigation items you don't use on desktop, and other distracting screen elements such as the account switcher and Messages drawer
- Hide the bottom nav item for Messages on mobile if you don't use it
- Hide items you don't use in the "More" menu (desktop) or slide-out menu (mobile)
